## 1. STRATEGIC FOUNDATION

### 1.1 Purpose of This Document

This manual defines how Alchemetryx positions itself globally, how we communicate our value, and how we architect messaging that attracts high-quality SME and SMB clients.

### 1.2 Why Positioning Matters

Clear positioning is what makes a consulting brand:
